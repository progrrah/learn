EDITING TERMS
Clip: A video segment.
Cover shot: A video clip that is used to cover an edit so that the viewers do not know that
the edit occurred. The term literally means to “cut away” from the action, and it can be
used to cover continuity errors or sometimes show a parallel action.
Continuity: The goal of the continuity person is to make sure that, from shot to shot,
everything is consistent and can easily be edited together. When something in the
scene is not consistent, it is called a continuity error.
Cut: The “cut” or “take” is the most common transition in editing. It is an instantaneous
switch from one shot to the next.
Cutaway shot: Used to cover edits when any sequence is shortened or lengthened.
Generally it is a shot of something outside of the current frame.
Digitize: Converting the video and audio signals into the appropriate data fi les.
Dissolve: An editing transition effect created by fading out one image while fading in the
next image.
DVE: Digital video effect.
Fade: A gradual change (dissolve) between black and a video image.
Filmic time: This editing technique tightens up the pace of a production by leaving out
potentially boring portions of the scene when the audience’s interest could wane.
FireWire: Also known as the IEEE 1394 or iLink, the FireWire is used to connect different
pieces of equipment, such as cameras, drives, and computers, so that they can
transfer large amounts of data, such as video, quickly and easily.
Jump cut: Created with the editor cuts between two similar shots (two close-ups) of the
same subject.
Linear editing: The copying, or dubbing, segments from the master tape to another tape
in sequential order.
Logging: Loggers view the footage and write down the scene/take numbers, the length of
each shot, the time code, and descriptions of each shot.
Nonlinear: The process where the recorded video is digitized (copied) onto a computer.
Then the footage can be arranged or rearranged, special effects can be added, and
the audio and graphics can be adjusted using editing software.
Running order: The order that the scenes or shots will be shown in the fi nal project, which
may differ greatly from the shooting order.
Shooting order: The order that the scenes or shots may be shot using the video camera,
which may differ greatly from the running order.
Timeline: The timeline usually includes multiple tracks of video, audio, and graphics in a
nonlinear editing system.
Trim: To cut frames off of a shot to make it shorter.
Voiceover: Commentary over video.
Wipe: A novel transition between two video images that can have many different shapes
and can have a hard- or soft-edge transition.
